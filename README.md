# Evaluating Wind Turbine Performance Using Power Curve Modelling
Wind turbine power curves describe the non-linear relationship between wind speed and the turbine power output. As part of a turbine’s specifications, manufacturers provide wind power curves with theoretical values which can be used as a benchmark to evaluate a wind turbine’s generating performance. However, wind turbines normally experience several stoppages in its daily operations due to various natural and technical factors, and sometimes have their outputs curtailed due to grid limitations. These instances result to abnormally low power outputs, which were not considered in the theoretical power curve, making it incomparable with the actual generation as it is.

This project aims to model a wind turbine’s performance under normal operating conditions to be compared to the theoretical power curve without bias, and quantify the difference in performance, which may be further used to estimate revenue losses due to performance which may help in making business decisions.
